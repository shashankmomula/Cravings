# Cravings üçΩÔ∏è

Cravings is my first learning project where I explored core React concepts like React Hooks, Tailwind CSS, Redux, and API handling. This project showcases restaurant data, including restaurant names, their menus, and allows users to add or remove items from the cart. Through Cravings, I gained a deeper understanding of React and enhanced my knowledge of essential web development concepts.

## **Features**
- **Restaurant Listings**: Display a list of restaurants and their menu items.
- **Cart Functionality**: Add and remove items from the cart.
- **Real-time API Integration**: Fetch restaurant data using the Swiggy API based on the user's locality.
- **State Management**: Manage the application state with Redux and Redux Toolkit.
- **Responsive UI**: Built a smooth and responsive user interface using Tailwind CSS.
- **React Hooks & Routing**: Leveraged React Hooks for state management and API handling, and implemented React Router for page navigation.

## **Technologies Used**
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and creating a responsive design.
- **Redux & Redux Toolkit**: For state management across the application.
- **Swiggy API**: For fetching live restaurant data based on locality.
- **Jest**: For testing the application functionality.
