# Cravings üçΩÔ∏è

Cravings is my first learning project, where I explored core React concepts like React Hooks, Tailwind CSS, Redux, and handling APIs. This project showcases restaurant data like restaurant names, their menus, and allows users to add or remove items from the cart. Through Cravings, I deepened my knowledge of React and learned essential web development concepts.

## Features
- Display a list of restaurants and their menu items.
- Add items to the cart and manage your cart by adding or removing items.
- Fetch real-time restaurant data using the Swiggy API based on locality.
- Implement state management using Redux and Redux Toolkit.
- Smooth and responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS.
- Learnings from React Hooks, API fetching, and routing concepts.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Redux & Redux Toolkit**: For state management.
- **Swiggy API**: For fetching restaurant data.
- **Jest**: For testing the app.

## Learnings
Throughout the development of Cravings, I gained hands-on experience in:
- React project setup from scratch.
- Deep dive into JSX and other core React features.
- Understanding Tailwind CSS basics and setting it up.
- Deep dive into all the important React Hooks.
- Exploring React Routing.
- Handling live API data and effectively managing it.
- Understanding Functional vs Class-Based Components.
- A deep dive into Redux and Redux Toolkit.
- Testing the application using Jest.

## Installation

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained in-depth understanding of **React Hooks** and their use in managing state and effects.
- Learned to integrate **APIs** and handle asynchronous data fetching.
- Improved skills in managing global state using **Redux**.
- Enhanced knowledge of UI styling with **Tailwind CSS**.
