# Cravings - Restaurant Listing and Food Ordering

This project, **Cravings**, is my first learning project where I explored the core React concepts like React Hooks, Redux, and API handling. It showcases data from restaurants, their menus, and allows users to add items to a cart, clear the cart, and more.

## Features
- Displays a list of restaurants and their menus.
- Add items to the cart, view the cart, and clear the cart functionality.
- Fetches live restaurant data using the **Swiggy API**.
- Interactive UI built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- State management using **Redux** for managing cart and menu data.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the dynamic user interface.
- **Redux**: For state management across components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Swiggy API**: Used for fetching restaurant data based on locality.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained in-depth understanding of **React Hooks** and their use in managing state and effects.
- Learned to integrate **APIs** and handle asynchronous data fetching.
- Improved skills in managing global state using **Redux**.
- Enhanced knowledge of UI styling with **Tailwind CSS**.
